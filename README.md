# Application with PHP, MVC and Routes

To simplifier I create one table, customer with only two fields, name and email.

## Discussion forum for the repository

I just created a forum to exchange ideas about MVC and router in PHP

https://github.com/ribafs/php-router/discussions

## Installation

See file INSTALL.md


## Application created based on mini3 
https://github.com/panique/mini3


## Main objective

When I created this app, I wanted to go out making adaptations to use the route in other apps and get better to be able to use it in production, but it's good to resist this temptation and remember...

The main objective of this application is not to create something to be used in production, but to create a structure in PHP using MVC and routes in the sense of learning these concepts in practice to better understand  and use a good PHP framework and this one to be used in production.
